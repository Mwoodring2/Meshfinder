# Placeholder for app.ico

This file should be replaced with a proper 256x256 multi-size ICO file for the application icon.

To create an app.ico file:
1. Create a 256x256 PNG image with your desired icon
2. Use an online ICO converter or tool like ImageMagick to convert it to ICO format
3. Replace this placeholder file with the actual app.ico

For now, the build will work without an icon, but you'll get a warning.
